## Hello Github
It's my intention to publicly host side and hobby projects in an attempt to contribute to the open source community and the digital age.


That'sÂ nice and vague and the same intention as any other gh user. But good enough for now.


I figure why not share my hobby projects. I'll probably never have time to produce any amazing new wonderful world changing thing, but who knows, someone might find something useful or at least interesting in them.
