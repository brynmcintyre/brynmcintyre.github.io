## Hello Github
In the future I'll be hosting some of my hobby projects on github and writing about them on this page. I also intend to contribute to existing projects in the open source community. Of course, I have recently started a family and so that along with the day job take priority over hobbies. Likely won't have time for much between late night feedings and barely getting sleep.

The hobby projects I share may not be useful to anyone, or even myself... but that's why it's called a hobby project.
